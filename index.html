   <p id="coding" ><strong> Why coding? </strong></p>
  <p>I am learning to code because I believe that web 3.0 will change the world. We have recently seen in Coronavirus how technology is changing the way that people work.  I believe that within the next five years technology will change the way that we work, we interact with each other and the way that we live. Billions of dollars are currently being invested by large corporations such as Microsoft and Facebook that are currently are building apps and software ready for the future.</p>
  <p>I have an interest in current innovation in blockchain, Web3, metaverse, cryptocurrencies and how they are becoming more integrated into our everyday lives. I have a particular interest in how webÂ£ can create a fairer society, because of my background in social work. Blockchain has already ensured that marginalised people within third world countries are now able to free banking and identities through the technology that is being developed.  This is why I have made the decision to pursue a career in web development.</p>

  <p id="about"> <strong>Thoughts about my journey</strong> </p>
  <p>I know that it is going to be a challenge to learn to code, but I love to solve problems, which I think will be a positive thing during the next few months. I know that it is going to be hard work, as I am learning a new language by pursuing this path, and some things will take time to understand, but I am looking forward to undertaking the challenge. I love to create and design things which I think will be a positive thing in my journey. </p>
